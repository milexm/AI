# Artificial Intelligence

![AI](media/ai_icon.png)

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science and a
 multidisciplinary field that deals with the development of intelligent machines
 and systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human
 intelligence.

 > [!IMPORTANT] 
 > :thumbsup: AI aims to create computer programs or algorithms that can `learn`,
 `reason`, `perceive` their environment, and `make decisions` to achieve specific
 goals.

AI can be broadly categorized into two main types:

> [!NOTE]  
> **Narrow or Weak AI**. This form of AI is designed to excel in a specific task or a limited set of tasks. It is highly specialized and lacks general intelligence. Examples of narrow AI include voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, recommendation systems used by streaming platforms, and chatbots used for customer service.

> [!WARNING]  
> **General or Strong AI**. This type of AI is hypothetical and refers to machines that possess human-level intelligence. General AI would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge in a manner similar to humans across various domains. As of now, true general AI does not exist, and its development remains a subject of research and speculation.
> 
> Despite its numerous benefits, AI also raises `ethical` and `societal concerns`, such as privacy, job displacement, bias in algorithms, and potential misuse of AI technologies.
